GameScreen:
/* It's a bad idea to directly call disposeAndExit() method, because, as it turned out,
* libgdx doesn't care about doing game.setScreen(null), so libgdx tries to perform
* render again, but now on the screen with disposed assets, which leads OpenGL to
* throw an exception.
* So there are to solutions:
* 1) Do not call disposeAndExit() method directly, but set a boolean variable (performExit = true)
* and check whether it's needed to perform exit at the end of the render() method
* 2) Use game.setScreen(null) before calling disposeAndExit() directly */
